Bengali Voice Assistant

This Python project is a voice-activated AI assistant for Bengali speakers. It uses <b>NeMo</b> for accurate speech-to-text conversion and BanglaTTS for natural-sounding Bengali voice output. The assistant integrates with an Ollama-powered Large Language Model (LLM) to provide intelligent and context-aware responses, creating a seamless conversational experience. The system is designed to run locally, ensuring privacy and fast performance.
